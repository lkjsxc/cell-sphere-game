# Balancing

The balance harness (`scripts/balance.mjs`) runs the **production**
simulation modules headlessly — never a copied or simplified model.

## Targets

- New-save balanced-policy median extinction: **270–330 game s**,
  narrow interquartile range ("about five minutes" must be truthful).
- Terminal ceiling ends ordinary runs by ~360 game s.
- Score bands: 20k–80k first runs · 80k–200k learning · 200k–450k strong ·
  450k–750k mastery · 750k+ exceptional.
- Echo income: first campaign resolution reachable in ~4 ordinary runs
  (18–24 min at 1×).
- No dead or dominant adaptation cards across relevant policies.
- Same seed + decisions ⇒ identical hash at any speed (gate).
- No NaN/Infinity/negative biomass/invalid neighbor/impossible score (gate).

## Bot policies

novice (random-valid) · balanced · expansion · resilience · efficiency ·
greedy-score · no-signal · no-progression · challenge-specific.
Each is a deterministic heuristic using only player-visible information.

## Smoke vs full

- `npm run balance:smoke` — bounded seed count (CI-safe, seconds).
- `npm run balance` — deep Monte Carlo; writes `reports/balance-*.json` and
  prints a Markdown summary. Reports are git-ignored; durable findings are
  copied into this document.

## Measured outcomes

| Date | Commit | Policy | n | median t | p25–p75 | peak cov | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-31 | (Gate B) | balanced | 4 | 361 s | 329–366 | 0.45 | first calibration; median slightly above 330 target |
| 2026-07-31 | (Gate B) | expansion | 4 | 325 s | 236–361 | 0.40 | wider spread, as expected |
| 2026-07-31 | (Gate B) | resilience | 4 | 361 s | 311–361 | 0.52 | highest coverage |

Initial read: extinction timing clusters near the terminal ceiling (360 s)
rather than the 270–330 median target — the collapse curve is currently the
dominant killer. Next tuning pass: strengthen mid-run pressure (events,
maintenance entropy scaling) so weak builds die before the ceiling while
strong builds still reach it. Sample size 4 is diagnostic, not conclusive.

## Score projection

The live HUD and terminal result both call `src/game/scoring.js`, a pure
projection of authoritative run metrics. It currently normalizes survival,
peak/sustained coverage, connectivity, energy efficiency, and crisis resolve;
quality, language, render cadence, and game speed are excluded. The six-part
interim display is tested for bounds and monotonicity. Its score bands need a
production-distribution calibration before contest claims.

## Tuning decisions

Record accepted tuning changes here with rationale and measured delta.
Golden fixture updates require an entry here — never blind snapshot resets.

- **2026-08-01 — UI score projection.** Added a deterministic live/terminal
  score and Echo projection; no simulation equation or golden checksum
  changed. Evidence: `tests/unit/scoring.test.js`; a balance recalibration is
  still required before changing thresholds or score bands.
