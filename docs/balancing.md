# Balancing

The balance harness (`scripts/balance.mjs`) runs the **production**
simulation modules headlessly — never a copied or simplified model.

## Targets

- New-save balanced-policy median extinction: **270–330 game s**,
  narrow interquartile range ("about five minutes" must be truthful).
- Terminal ceiling ends ordinary runs by ~360 game s.
- Score bands: 20k–80k first runs · 80k–200k learning · 200k–450k strong ·
  450k–750k mastery · 750k+ exceptional.
- Echo income: first campaign resolution reachable in ~4 ordinary runs
  (18–24 min at 1×).
- No dead or dominant adaptation cards across relevant policies.
- Same seed + decisions ⇒ identical hash at any speed (gate).
- No NaN/Infinity/negative biomass/invalid neighbor/impossible score (gate).

## Bot policies

novice (random-valid) · balanced · expansion · resilience · efficiency ·
greedy-score · no-signal · no-progression · challenge-specific.
Each is a deterministic heuristic using only player-visible information.

## Smoke vs full

- `npm run balance:smoke` — bounded seed count (CI-safe, seconds).
- `npm run balance` — deep Monte Carlo; writes `reports/balance-*.json` and
  prints a Markdown summary. Reports are git-ignored; durable findings are
  copied into this document.

## Measured outcomes

Record accepted tuning changes here with rationale and measured delta.
Golden fixture updates require an entry here — never blind snapshot resets.
